## The Problem and For Whom

Public transit is halfway to anywhere, and is currently an obstacle for people who are blind. Even sighted people have some 
trouble navigating Park Street, but for a person who is blind locating the entrance, correct platform, the bathroom, or the exit 
can be a real struggle. Additionally, the threat of walking into a moving train or falling off the platform is constantly looming 
in the background. We heard a story from one person who is blind who suddenly found his cane in mid air while walking, hanging over
the edge of the platform, which inspired him to get a seeing eye dog and stop relying on his cane in the subway. Others decide that
public transit is too intimidating for use alone or at all. Highly technical solutions to public navigation exist, but these 
solutions are expensive and only slightly better than existing products. Navigating familiar spaces is easier than novel ones, 
but can still pose issues since their layout may change without notice.
