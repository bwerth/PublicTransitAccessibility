## Our Project

Public transit is halfway to anywhere, and is currently an obstacle for people who are blind. Even sighted people have some trouble navigating Park Street, but for a person who is blind locating the entrance, correct platform, the bathroom, or the exit can be a real struggle. We seek to rectify this problem by iteratively developing an improved user experience.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bwerth/PublicTransitAccessibility/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bwerth/PublicTransitAccessibility/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
